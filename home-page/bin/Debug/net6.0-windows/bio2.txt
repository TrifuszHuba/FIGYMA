Hi, I'm John. I'm a 25 year old single man living in Toronto. I work in IT and I'm currently studying web development on the side, hoping to make the switch over to a full-time career. On my days off, I like to explore new places and dive into a good book. I also enjoy playing tennis and running, as keeping fit is important to me. I'm an outgoing person and I like to surround myself with people who share similar interests. I'm always up for a new adventure and I'm always looking for ways to better myself.
