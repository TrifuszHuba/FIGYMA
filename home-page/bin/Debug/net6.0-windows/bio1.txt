I'm a single man in my early thirties and I'm from Tennessee. I love the outdoors and like to stay active, so I spend a lot of time fishing, hiking, and going for walks. I'm an introvert, but I'm always looking for ways to meet new people and have good conversations. In my spare time, I'm usually reading, learning something new, or tackling a new project. I'm passionate about growing my career and I'm currently studying computer science. I'm ambitious and driven, and never stop striving to be better every day.
