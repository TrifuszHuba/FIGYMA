Hello, my name is John and I am from the United States. I currently work in the medical field, where I help patients with their healthcare needs. I have a degree in Biology, and I am passionate about helping others and advancing my knowledge in the medical field. In my free time I like to go to the beach and fitness activities like running. I have a few close friends whom I cherish, but I am still looking for that special someone. I am an adventurous person and am open to trying new things and discovering different cultures.
