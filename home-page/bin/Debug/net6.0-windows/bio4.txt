My name is Jack, and I'm a 34-year-old single guy. I love leading an active life exploring the outdoors, and I'm always looking for adventures. A typical weekend for me includes mountain biking, snow skiing and rock climbing. When I'm not spending time in nature, I'm working as a software engineer. Helping people solve problems with technology brings me a lot of satisfaction and balance in life. I'm also a big fan of reading and love to stay up to date with the latest tech advancements.
