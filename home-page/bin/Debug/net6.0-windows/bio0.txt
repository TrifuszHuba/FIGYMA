My name is Jim and I'm a single 40-year-old living and working in London. I'm a finance professional who loves the city life. On the weekends I like to explore, socialize and stay active. I enjoy running, cycling, tennis and generally getting out and about in London. As well as keeping fit, I like to chill out with friends, see a movie, or just appreciate the incredible culture our city has to offer. Life can get a bit hectic, but I wouldn't have it any other way!
